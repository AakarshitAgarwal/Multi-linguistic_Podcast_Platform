### Introduction:
This software requirements specification document lists sufficient and necessary requirements for the development of our project- “Multi-linguistic podcast platform”.
To derive the requirements, the developers need to have a clear and thorough understanding of the products under development. This is achieved through detailed and continuous communications with the project team and customers throughout the software development process.

### Overview:
In numerous investigations, it has been discovered that audience members of podcasts create progressively distinctive pictures in their psyches and have elevated levels of passionate association in the story. Since audience members of podcasts are just tuning in to a story and not seeing it, it makes them need to utilize their creative mind and fabricate pictures of who and what they are tuning in to in their mind. Hence, their minds are more solid and clear than the individuals who do not tune in to podcasts. What comes in addition is the fact that the target audience is diverse and expects to avail this advancement in the language they speak/understand.
That is what lead us to create such a platform where the podcasts will be available in all the popular languages, so that you can tune into your favorite one any time, on the go.

## 5. Risk Management:

Our podcast platform is sure to outpace the existing ones because it features translating the existing podcasts into the user-preferred language.
Still, there lies a risk of keeping users engaged with our platform and attract their attention every time they need to listen to a podcast, while stuck in traffic on their way to work/home, or before plunging into their beds. While having a shower or while cooking in the kitchen.
This requires bringing proper recommendations to them, so the team needs to acknowledge this need.
Another risk can be the authenticity of the content. Therefore, our team has to work towards verifying the resources from where the content is being fetched.
