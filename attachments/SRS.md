## 5. Risk Management:

Our podcast platform is sure to outpace the existing ones because it features translating the existing podcasts into the user-preferred language.
Still, there lies a risk of keeping users engaged with our platform and attract their attention every time they need to listen to a podcast, while stuck in traffic on their way to work/home, or before plunging into their beds. While having a shower or while cooking in the kitchen.
This requires bringing proper recommendations to them, so the team needs to acknowledge this need.
Another risk can be the authenticity of the content. Therefore, our team has to work towards verifying the resources from where the content is being fetched.
